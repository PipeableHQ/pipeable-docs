[Webviews](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview) are essentially in-app browsers that display web content directly within the app. If you are familiar with Puppeteer or Playwright, Pipeable serves a similar purpose but for these embedded browsers, offering granular control over web interactions.\n\n### What can you use Pipeable for?\n\nYou can use Pipeable anytime you want to automate interactions with third-party websites within your mobile app. To illustrate, let's dive into a concrete example: an automation that searches HackerNews for a specific query (in this case \"web automation\") and retrieves the titles of relevant stories.\n\n```swift\n// Navigate to a web page\ntry? await page.goto(\"https://news.ycombinator.com\", waitUntil: .networkidle)\n\n// Wait for the search form to load so we can interact with it\nlet searchForm = try await page.waitForXPath(\n    \"//form[contains(@action, 'hn.algolia.com')]\", visible: true\n)\n\n// Find the search bar text input and type the query \"web automation\" into it\nlet textAreaEl = try await searchForm?.querySelector(\"input[type='text']\")\ntry await textAreaEl!.type(\"web automation\", delay: 50)\n\n// Submit the search\ntry await page.submitActiveForm()\n\n// Wait for the results page\ntry await page.waitForURL { url in url.contains(\"hn.algolia\") }\n\n// Wait for the search results to be visible\ntry await page.waitForSelector(\".Story_title\", visible: true)\n\n// Get all the story title elements from the page\nlet stories = try await page.querySelectorAll(\".Story_title a > span\")\n\nvar storyTitles: [String] = []\nfor story in stories {\n    // Get the text content for each story title\n    if let title = try await story.textContent() {\n        storyTitles.append(title)\n    }\n}\nprint(storyTitles)\n```\n\nA couple of things to note:\n\n- The automation is operating directly on the website’s document object model (DOM) and allows you, the developer, to do anything that a user can do, even if there is no API or the API is restricted.\n- If you are familiar with Playwright or Puppeteer then the above code should look familiar to you and this is intentional, we designed Pipeable to be compatible with these frameworks (see Pipeable Scripting below).\n- You can try out the above code by running [this sample app](https://github.com/PipeableHQ/pipeable-ios-samples).\n\n### Agentic AI\n\n### Why webviews and Pipeable?\n\nWe think that Pipeable and webviews are a great fit for a number of reasons:\n\n- Because webviews are integrated with mobile OS-es, users can log into websites using their preferred mobile authentication workflow (leveraging FaceID, TouchID, etc.) without the need to explicitly share or type credentials. Handling CAPTCHAs, 2FA, etc. is similarly fluid.\n- Automations leverage the website’s document object model (DOM) and allow AI agents to do anything that a user can do, even when there is no API or the API is restricted.\n- Automations can be executed entirely on the client for better privacy and security. Developers can offer an option to continue the session in the cloud using Pipeable Scripting for better convenience and more flexibility.\n\n### Pipeable Scripting\n\nPipeableScript is a runtime that allows Pipeable developers to write their automation scripts in Typescript/Javascript and still execute these scripts on mobile. This has two key benefits:\n\n- You can dynamically load your scripts into your app at runtime, this means that if the underlying website changes and your automation breaks you can simply fix the script and deploy it to your app without going through the full app update process.\n- The scripts you write are broadly compatible[^1] with Playwright and Puppeteer, this means that you can run your PipeableScript in Playwright or Puppeteer if you want to execute your script on a server. This can be especially helpful for certain types of tasks which are long running or compute intensive.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThanks for making it this far!
